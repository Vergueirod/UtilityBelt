# [WIP Ever] ðŸ¦‡ UtilityBelt 
The purpose of this repo is to be my (and yours if you want) technology utility belt, it's where I add all the topics I study, so basically all the other repos here are constantly evolving as I come across new day-to-day challenges.

## Gateways & Identity Management

### API Gateways:
- **Kong** â€“ Extensible with plugins, ideal for rate limiting, logging, transformations, etc.
- **NGINX** â€“ Reverse proxy, load balancer, TLS termination, basic API gateway features

### Identity & Access Management (IAM):
- **Keycloak** â€“ Open-source IAM, suporte a OAuth2, OIDC, SAML, RBAC
- Concepts: OAuth2, OpenID Connect, SSO, RBAC, Identity Federation

### Reverse Proxy Patterns:
- Layer 7 routing
- TLS offloading
- Caching
- Rate limiting & throttling

## APIs:
- REST
- RESTful
- GraphQL
- gRPC
- WebSocket
- SOAP

## Asynchronous Communication:
- RabbitMQ
- Kafka

## Linux:
- Basic commands

## IaC:
- Terraform

## Virtualization and Containerization:
- Docker

## Container orchestration
- Kubernetes

## Monitoring/observability:
- Metrics
- DataDog
- Grafana

## CI/CD (Continuous Integration / Continuous Delivery)

### Concepts and Best Practices:
- **Continuous Integration (CI)**
  - Automate builds and test runs
  - Validate pull requests and code merges
- **Continuous Delivery vs. Continuous Deployment**
  - *Delivery*: Code is production-ready, but deployment is manual
  - *Deployment*: Code is automatically deployed to production
- **Pipelines as Code**
- **Environment Strategy**
  - Dev, Staging, Production environments
- **Automated Testing**
  - Unit, integration, end-to-end (E2E) tests as part of the pipeline
- **Deployment Strategies**
  - Blue/Green deployments
  - Canary releases
  - Feature toggles
- **Rollback Mechanisms**
  - Versioned deploys, health checks, circuit breakers
- **Monitoring & Alerts**
  - Integrate observability post-deploy

### Common CI/CD Tools:
- **GitHub Actions** â€“ Native to GitHub, easy to use and extend
- **GitLab CI/CD** â€“ Full integrated CI/CD with powerful features
- **CircleCI** â€“ Cloud-native, performant pipelines
- **Jenkins** â€“ Highly customizable, plugin-based system
- **Bitbucket Pipelines** â€“ Simple integration for Bitbucket users
- **Argo CD** â€“ GitOps-based CD for Kubernetes
- **Tekton Pipelines** â€“ Kubernetes-native CI/CD framework

### Frequent Integrations:
- **Docker** â€“ Build, tag, and push images as part of the pipeline
- **Kubernetes** â€“ Deploy using `kubectl`, Helm, or Argo CD
- **Terraform** â€“ Integrate infrastructure provisioning
- **Secrets Management** â€“ Use secure systems (GitHub Secrets, Vault)
- **Notifications** â€“ Slack, Discord, email alerts for pipeline events

### Pro Tips:
- Enforce code quality with **linters and static analysis**
- Use **build/test matrices** to test against multiple versions
- Clearly separate pipeline stages: `build â†’ test â†’ package â†’ deploy â†’ monitor`
- Store **build artifacts** in secure registries (Docker Hub, GitHub Packages, etc.)
- Always version your pipeline configuration (`.yml` files) within the repo
